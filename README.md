## ðŸŽ¥ Underwater Video Object Detection Test (DFFR-Net)

To further evaluate the real-world adaptability of the proposed DFFR-Net, we applied the model to real-shot underwater videos for object detection testing. The test does not involve any post-processing such as temporal smoothing; only the raw outputs of the model are used for visualization. Results show that DFFR-Net effectively handles challenges such as lighting variations, background interference, and target deformation in underwater environments, demonstrating strong real-time detection capability and robustness.
